# Sia-Nextcloud

This is the [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) Sia storage backend implementation. It adds a 'Sia' option to the External Files Nextcloud app, allowing users to upload and download from a Sia node through the Nextcloud UI.

## Requirements

This requires one parameter to work, an API Address. This API Address must point to a reachable, synchronized Sia node that has money set aside in an allowance.
